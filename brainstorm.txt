### Revamp for UI ###

Button interface brainstorm

   Button phases
   1. intro - begin button
   2. number of rounds selection
   3. player move selection

   How do we get to each phase? (verb functions)
   1. replaceBeginGameButton (should rename to presentNumRoundsInterface)
   2. presentPlayerSelectionInterface
   3. presentBeginGameInterface

Overall game flow

   Tools at our disposal:
   1. beginGame
   2. determineWinner
   3. playSingleRoundOfRPS
   4. getComputerChoice
   - BUTTON ONLY RETURNS PROVIDES CHOICE; KEEP BUTTON BEHAVIOR SIMPLE
   - run beginGame
      - playSingleRoundOfRPS a user defined number of times
         - getComputerChoice
            - determineWinner
         - updateTally
            - also updates UI tally
      - determineOverallWinner
         - if human > computer ? "You won best of ###!"
         - if computer > human ? "Computer won best of ###!"
         - "It's a tie!"
