### Revamp for UI ###

Button interface brainstorm

   Button phases
   1. intro - begin button
   2. number of rounds selection
   3. player move selection

   How do we get to each phase? (verb functions)
   1. presentNumRoundsInterface
   2. presentPlayerSelectionInterface
   3. presentBeginGameInterface

   Function breakdown
   presentNumRoundsInterface
      1. declare all requied variable/consts
      2. clear our container
      3. setup input element attributes
      4. setup input prompt label
      5. setup submit button
      6. append all children to the container we cleared out

Overall game flow

   Tools at our disposal:
   1. beginGame
   2. determineWinner
   3. playSingleRoundOfRPS
   4. getComputerChoice
   - BUTTON ONLY RETURNS PROVIDES CHOICE; KEEP BUTTON BEHAVIOR SIMPLE
   - run beginGame
      - playSingleRoundOfRPS a user defined number of times
         - getComputerChoice
            - determineWinner
         - updateTally
            - also updates UI tally
      - determineOverallWinner
         - if human > computer ? "You won best of ###!"
         - if computer > human ? "Computer won best of ###!"
         - "It's a tie!"

Overall game flow (reworked)

   1. user hits 'begin game'
      a. triggers presentNumRoundsInterface
         - addEventListener to submit button to presentPlayerSelectionInterface
   2. user hits 'submit'
      a. triggers presentPlayerSelectionInterface
         - addEventListener to each player selection button to beginGame
   3. beginGame gets hit a user-defined number of times
      a. once user-defined number of games is played, presentBeginGameInterface

getFinalGameStatus
- human > computer ? you won best of ###
- computer > human ? computer won best of ###
- else ? tie
